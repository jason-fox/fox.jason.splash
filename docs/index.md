<h1>Splash Screen for DITA-OT</h1>

This simple DITA-OT plug-in automatically displays a random cat picture from the [Cat API](http://thecatapi.com/) or an
[xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) comic strip as a splash screen whilst waiting for a build job to complete.

### The Cat API

The Cat API was created by Aden Forshaw back in 2012 as a way to give back and help teach people to code, it’s now been
used by thousands of App developers making all sorts of weird & wonderful creations.

It allows anyone to build apps that search for Cat images, upload their own, vote or favourite them, and to allow their
users to do the same.

It’s completely free to use & primarily a learning tool to teach anyone the basics of using APIs in a fun & interesting
way. Perfect for classrooms, hackathons, or weekend side projects.

### XKCD

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/compiling.png)

xkcd, sometimes styled XKCD is a webcomic created by Randall Munroe. The comic's tagline describes it as "A webcomic of
romance, sarcasm, math, and language". Munroe states on the comic's website that the name of the comic is not an
initialism but "just a word with no phonetic pronunciation".

The subject matter of the comic varies from statements on life and love to mathematical, programming, and scientific
in-jokes. Some strips feature simple humor or pop-culture references. Although it has a cast of stick figures, the comic
occasionally features landscapes, graphs and charts, and intricate mathematical patterns such as fractals. New cartoons
are added three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
